    <p id="tfcp">TFC is just another group of people. We want to innovate, we want to bring about changes, we want to do something for our planet with the power of science and technology. And in this attempt, we want to include as many people as possible. We need capable people, we need visionaries, in a nutshell, we need YOU. So, are you ready to work on our new project?

    <h2>Tefaco</h2>
    <p id="tefacop">The planet is plagued by countless evils. Cases of harassment and rapes are at all time high. No one can walk around feeling safe. Can anything subdue this crisis? Enter, Tefaco. A watch, but not just a watch. A solution. To problems, everyone's problems, planet's problems. Reality? Not yet. That's why we need you. What we envision is a device capable of neutralizing any threats on anyone whilst also being something anybody would wear. Sounds easy? It ain't. Currently we intend it to have a stun gun built in. But we are ready to see where you take this. </p>
