    <p>We, at The Faded Cosmos always strive to make the best use of technology. We find ways in which technology can help us resolve major issues that we face in our daily lives. This watch too is a part of our initiative to proliferate a message of safety among women.This watch has a simple design, and quite suitable for day to day use. But on a second thought, we are not here to sell watches, are we? We are here to make something that will make all the women around the world feel safe and sound. This watch will feature special safety devices such as a built in taser and a pepper spray. It will also feature GPS technology.The mechanism of the watch is quite simple. It's a simple quartz watch from top. There is a metal rim around the dial. There is pepper spray below. In the bottom, we have photoplethysmographic light sensors, which will activate the tasers when they sense a sudden rise in heartbeat.( This option should be turned on in public places and off in homes).This watch is being currently built by our engineers and will be available in commercial market after a few months. It's a tiny step, that we are willing to take, in our long path of transforming the world, and making it a better place.
