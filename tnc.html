    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1><br>
    <h4>Carefully read these terms and conditions before proceeding.</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>We are not a stable financially supported institution yet. So, do not expect to get any immediate monetary returns to the efforts you put in to the project. 
      <li>Any compromise of ideas and methods that belong to the organization would be dealt with strictly, and a legal action might also be taken against severe cases.
      <li>We expect openness, tolerance and respect towards others' ideas and opinions, and a rational mindset from everyone.
      <li>To proceed to being a part of us, you'll need to fill up the form linked to the next page, and wait for an approval of your application. It will be followed by an interview process, which will finally decide your eligibility to join the group.
